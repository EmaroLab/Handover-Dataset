## Infos and Personal Datas

This table, about the Controlled Experiments, is ment to gather all the information that were not possible to be written anywhere else about particulars of some of the phases of the experiments.
These data have been collected during the experiments execution both through direct volunteers' comments and through our own observations.
Unfortunately we have not been able to put in this schema all the comments that we collected because of their uniqueness. Those are still in each quesstionnaire file in the blue enhanced boxes.

Important Clarifications:

- "\" stands for data not collected

- The second column is for showing the fact that there exist two different type of volunteers: the ones who percieved the higest grade (#4) with a positive meaning and the ones who gave to that value a negative meaning as explained in the Data Paper. It is important to note that, since we did not ask to answer any question in order to understand this data, we have expressed it only when it was clear. When it results as not collected, usually, it is because the answer was "no".

-In the last column, "Peculiarity", the term "validation" is for expressing the fact that the volunteer under analisys did not perform the whole experiment as the others, but instead, he did twice half of the experiments. This data could be used to perform an error study about the answers of the questionnaires.

Non-Controlled Experimets:

In the folder concerning this part of the work there is the rank written by each volunteers about the object involved in this part of the experiment. It is important to notice that three of them forgot to list one element confusing it with the ball used in the Controlled eperiments and one assigned the same position to two of them. In these cases we have moved the rank by one step, so instead of being between 1 to 8 it goes just to 7.
